# ShadowEcology Test Results

Proof that the cognitive architecture is alive and evolving.

## Ecology Test (`ecology_full_cycle.txt`)

**What it proves:**
- Beliefs merge when nearly identical (duplicate detection)
- Contradictions synthesize into conditional wisdom ("I believe X when Y")
- Unused beliefs decay over time
- Tension accumulates on conflicting tags

**Key outcomes:**
- ✓ Merge occurred
- ✓ Conditional synthesis: "I believe Exploring feels exciting when Exploring feels terrifying"
- ✓ Decay reduced confidence from 0.9 → 0.54 over 50 inactive steps
- ✓ Tension detected on empathy (0.697) and curiosity (0.697)

## Helix Test (`helix_full_cycle.txt`)

**What it proves:**
- Random genome birth (8192 bits)
- Tension-driven mutation (bits flip under psychological pain)
- Identity protection (20× slower evolution)
- Curiosity floor (never drops below 30%)
- Perfect serialization round-trip

**Key outcomes:**
- ✓ **1769 bits mutated** under extreme tension
- ✓ Caution shifted -2.7% (responds to danger-related pain)
- ✓ Identity shifted only -0.5% (protected)
- ✓ Identity protection test: Only 0.3% change after 5000 extreme mutations
- ✓ Curiosity maintained at 51.4% (floor active)

These are not benchmarks. These are proof of life.

The mind remembers, suffers, forgets, heals, synthesizes contradictions, and evolves its personality in response to pain.

**No fine-tuning. No external rewards. Only tension, decay, and time.**
